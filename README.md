# Diabetes-Project 
Having gained experience with machine learning models, including both classification and regression tasks, I became motivated to explore deep learning models as well. Neural networks are widely recognized as one of the most important tools in AI, with numerous significant applications, particularly in medicine. In this project, I wanted to build a simple neural network and observe its performance compared to traditional machine learning models, such as logistic regression, on a diabetes dataset. The goal was to predict whether a patient has diabetes or not.

# Building the model
Firstly, I imported the dataset and defined my data frame. Next, I split the data into training and test sets using an 80-20 ratio, with 80% for training and 20% for testing, in order to ensure proper evaluation of the model's performance (as usual).

In this case, it was necessary to normalize the features in X_train and X_test (scaling) to ensure that all variables were on the same scale, thereby improving the performance and stability of the model.
