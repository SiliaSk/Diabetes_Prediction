# Diabetes-Project 
Having gained experience with machine learning models, including both classification and regression tasks, I became motivated to explore deep learning models as well. Neural networks are widely recognized as one of the most important tools in AI, with numerous significant applications, particularly in medicine. In this project, I wanted to build a simple neural network and observe its performance compared to traditional machine learning models, such as logistic regression, on a diabetes dataset. The goal was to predict whether a patient has diabetes or not.
